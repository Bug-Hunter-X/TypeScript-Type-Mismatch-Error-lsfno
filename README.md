This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error involving type mismatches. The `bug.ts` file contains a function that expects two numbers as input but is called with a string and a number.  This results in a TypeScript compile-time error. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version of the code.  This example highlights the importance of TypeScript's type system in catching potential errors early in the development process.
